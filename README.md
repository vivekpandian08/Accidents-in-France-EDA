# Exploratory Data Aanlysis on Accidents in France (2005-2016)
Data analysis on accidents in France (2005 - 2016) was performed to reveal trends. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were used to create several visualisation like stacked bar charts, histograms, nested pie charts and heatmap. Below were the inferences:
1. For all years, the lowest number of accidents occur in February, followed by a dip in August. Highest number of accidents occur in the months of June and October.
2. Highest number of accidents occur during 5:00 - 6:00pm,  when people are commuting from work or going on a leisure ride.
3. Users in the age group of 20-50 incurring maximum number of accidents.
